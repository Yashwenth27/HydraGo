A hyper-local urban mobility application designed for **Hyderabad commuters**. 

Unlike generic maps, this app is built on a **Zero-Cost Architecture** using OpenStreetMap and Open Data. It acts as a **Smart Aggregator**, comparing public transport (TSRTC/Metro) against private cabs (Uber/Rapido) to help users save money and time, while keeping them safe with live civic alerts.
